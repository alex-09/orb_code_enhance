# For TestCases: Just a quick note
1. (unstable) The `main.py` in TestCases is where we will conduct the tests.

# For AppFunctions
1. The main.py will give you an idea on how to use the AMADEO-BAUTISTA-LINGAD ORB algorithm.
2. Feel free to ask questions about the things that you do not understand.
