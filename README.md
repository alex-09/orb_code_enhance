# For Comparisons
1. This is the main code to compare different algorithms

# For AppFunctions
1. The main.py will give you an idea on how to use the AMADEO-BAUTISTA-LINGAD ORB algorithm.
    - `load_images_from_folder` method takes the images from a local folder and put it into a list that returns `[[filename0, image0], [filename1, image1], ...]`  
    - `matches` and `visuals` variable is where the output of our algorithm is stored. 
    - The `matches` list variable returns:
        - index 0 | match_query_filename
        - index 1 | match_test_filename
        - index 2 | good_matches
        - index 3 | nfeatures
        - index 4 | total_matches
    - comments are provided in the main.py for more details
